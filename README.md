This is a small Autoit automation script made for a friend of mine


The settings file ->
	a.ini
			contains the parameters
	Eg. parameters ->

	prog = "C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe"
	url1 = "www.google.com"
	url2 = "www.yahoo.com"
	time = 1000
	check = 0

All The parameters are self-explanatory.

This on compiling gives a.exe

This opens a browser and two tabs of the different urls given
the tabs automatically switches after the given time
